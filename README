This directory contains code for an improved subcolumn generator for COSP,
using the Raisanen et al. (2004) cloud generator, with variability treatment
applied to both clouds and precipitation. Also included are the SCOPS and
PREC_SCOPS codes from COSP. SCOPS is included for comparison, to have a single
code here that can do both.
